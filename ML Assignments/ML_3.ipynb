This usually entails exposing the algorithm to a large amount of training data, allowing the model to study the output, and fine-tuning the parameters until the desired results are obtained. The machine can then be put to the test by allowing it to generate predictions for a \"validation data set,\" or new data that hasn't been seen before.\n",

    "In Supervised Learning, a machine is trained using ‘labeled’ data. Datasets are said to be labeled when they contain both input and output parameters. In other words, the data has already been tagged with the correct answer.\n",
    "1. Regression\n",
    "In regression, a single output value is produced using training data. This value is a probabilistic interpretation, which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables. For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc. \n",

    "In logistic regression, the output has discrete values based on a set of independent variables. This method can flounder when dealing with non-linear and multiple decision boundaries. Also, it is not flexible enough to capture complex relationships in datasets. \n",

    "2. Classification\n",
    "It involves grouping the data into classes.  If you are thinking of extending credit to a person, you can use classification to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter. When the supervised learning algorithm labels input data into two distinct classes, it is called binary classification. Multiple classifications means categorizing data into more than two classes.\n",

A random forest model would accomplish the task, given the demographic and educational factors of a set of students who have previously taken the test. "
